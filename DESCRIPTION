Description: Vine Copulas are very flexible statistical models and are basis of the package VineCopula. However, they become quite complex in higher dimensions (d > 50). This package 
    uses methods from graphical models and univariate model selection to estimate high dimensional vine copula structures and sparsity patterns.
