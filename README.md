This R-package contains functions for estimation of sparse high dimensional R-vines. 
The later are flexible dependence models which become complex in higher dimensions. 
We provide several methods for fast selection of the so called R-vine structure, which describes the decomposition.
Additionally, our methods all induce some natural method to control for the sparsity of the underlying modell.
